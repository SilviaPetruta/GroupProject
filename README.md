<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was built within a few days by two people working collaboratively. LiveShare and GitHub were the primary methods of collaboration and version control. 

The objective of this project was to get to grips with React.js, and by using an already existing platform it meant that one element (design) was already taken care of.

During the construction of this project, we learned how to break down a website or application into components, and figured out how they work together to create a final product.

A list of commonly used resources that we found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
